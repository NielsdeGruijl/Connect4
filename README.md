# Connect4

All game logic and assets were made by me, except for the skybox which is linked below.

This is a connect 4 "PvP" game where the goal is to get the opponents "health" down to 0 to win the game. A simple connect 4 will give you 100 points, but if that connect 4 has more that 4 coins you get 100 bonus points per extra coin. There are multipliers scattered around the grid, if you make a connect4 over one (or more) of these multipliers it gets multiplied to your score. But watch out! There are negative multipliers as well which will lower your score!
